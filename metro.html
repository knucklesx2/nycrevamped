One main improvement to the Metro North Station and Fordham Plaza, was the adding of lighting to a very dim and dark train station. Here is a picture of windows that allow natural light to shine through, as well as greenery from Fordham University next door.

The designs again allows natural lighting to flow through to brighten the place. the more opened station should be safer. I also noticed a lot more visible cameras.

  <p04>Renovation of the surrounding areas of the Metro North Station are clearly seen. More greenery was added. Many shrubs and trees were planted. Wood is use throughout the Plaza to make it more eco-friendly looking. Wood ceilings on the outdoor structures, and several circular wood benches, makes the place look more like a park. </p04></div>

<h5>My New York</h5>
   <p05>
     The Newly Renovated <u>Metro North Station,</u> had two awesome sculptures near the Metro North Station for a short period of time. One looked like a small child the other looked like a large owl, made of metal. I had wondered what happened to them, not knowing that they were there temporary.  Bringing art work to the Fordham area is such a great idea because the Fordham area does not really have permanent sculptures like other boroughs. Someday I will like to see more artwork at the Fordham Plaza area. Perhaps a permanent piece of art at the Metro North Station would be nice addition to the Plaza. In the meantime this was such a beautiful and welcoming piece for the Bronx.  If you would like to see one of the sculptures and learn more about it's designer you can click on this link, to go to &quot;the bronxchronicle.com&quot; article:  <a href="http://thebronxchronicle.com/2014/04/12/tomorrow-by-akihiro-ito/">"Tomorrow" by Akihiro Ito.</a></p05> <br>
