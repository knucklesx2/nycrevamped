        <h4>I Wanted To Be With Them!</h4>
        <p class="five">
            My high school days was a challenge. I hated high school with a passion. As soon as I entered the ninth grade, I was counting down the days until graduation. By the time I got to the tenth grade, I was ready to drop out! I stood up to my mother and told her that I was not going back. High school was a waste of my time. High School was the Government's Education, that is being forced on kids, who donâ€™t want it. Also, I will no longer aim for &quot;A's.&quot; &quot;A&quot; stands for Aneurism, that you get from studying. It didn't matter whether one kid get an &quot;A&quot; and the other get a &quot;D&quot; both kids will graduate, I said. My new goal was to strive for &quot;Ds&quot; and make my life easier. It was all planned out perfectly. I was going down to <i>Wall Street.</i><br>I wanted to be with them, and sleep in the tents with college students who were already down there fighting for the &quot;Cause.&quot; The college students were protesting against the government. <u>The Occupy Wall Street Movement</u> was the hottest thing and at fifteen I wanted to join them. Of course, I slept with one eye opened that night because mom did not say a word! The next day I got up and went to school realizing that at fifteen nobody was going to let me sleep in tents on the streets of Manhattan. Also, I remembered that my friends and I had an appointment to play <u>Call of Duty</u> online after school and it was Papa John Friday. What did you expect, &quot;Gimme a Break,&quot; after all I was a MINOR! Graduation was one of the best days of my life. It meant no more school. That I had survived and completed the Government's Education and was proud! LOL.<br> Just Another N.Y. Moment. <br><span class="highlight">Thanks for Visiting.  - Tyrell E. Stokes</span></p>
